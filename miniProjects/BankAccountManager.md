# Sample menu:
1. Create Account
2. Deposit
3. Withdraw
4. Transfer
5. Check Balance
6. Exit

# What it does?
=> Allow any number of accounts using ArrayList<BankAccount>.
=> Menu-driven operations: deposit, withdraw, transfer, check balance.
=> Use OOP with operator-like methods (deposit, withdraw, compareBalances).
