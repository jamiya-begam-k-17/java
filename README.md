# Java Learning & Mini Projects

This repository documents my Java learning journey, organized into **core fundamentals**, **DSA practice**, and **mini projects** built from scenario-based problem statements (college LMS / Cisco-aligned coursework).

The focus is on **clear logic, clean structure, and runnable code**, not just completing exercises.

## 🧱 Java Basics

Contains small, focused programs covering:
- loops and conditional statements  
- methods and parameter passing  
- object-oriented programming concepts  

**Goal:** strong foundation and syntax clarity.

---

## 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

Java implementations of commonly used problem-solving patterns:
- arrays and strings  
- recursion basics  
- searching and sorting algorithms  

**Focus areas:**
- logic building  
- edge case handling  
- readable and modular code

## 🛠 Mini Projects

Small Java applications created from **scenario-based requirements**.

Each mini project:
- is self-contained  
- has its own `Main.java`  
- includes a short README  
- can be compiled and run independently  

### Examples
- **Student Management System**  
  Manage student records using core Java and OOP concepts.

- **Astrology Converter**  
  Date-based logic with validation and control flow.

- **Number Utilities**  
  Reusable programs for numeric and string-based operations.

**Purpose:** translate problem statements into working applications.
